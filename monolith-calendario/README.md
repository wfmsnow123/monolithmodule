## What You Get

**Calendar HUD:** Animated dome widget with sky gradients, sun/moon tracking, and drag-anywhere positioning. Shows current weather, date, and event indicators at a glance. Collapse it to a sleek bar when you need screen space. Scenes automatically dim at sunset and brighten at dawn.

**MiniCal & BigCal:** Quick month view for daily use, plus full month/week/year views when you need the big picture. Day cells show weather pips, moon phases, and note indicators. Hover for details, click to add notes, right-click for context actions.

**Smart Notes:** Schedule notes with a condition engine: 41 fields, 11 operators, boolean logic (AND/OR/NAND/XOR/COUNT), and nesting up to 5 levels deep. "Every full moon", "2nd Tuesday in winter", "3 days after Festival X" all work. Notes support three visibility levels (Visible/Hidden/Secret), three display styles (icon/pip/banner), and multi-day durations that render as continuous bars in BigCal. Note presets define defaults and force overrides. Get reminded via chat, popup, or notification.

**Weather, Moons & Eclipses:** 42 weather presets across standard, severe, environmental, and fantasy categories. Climate zones with per-season overrides. Intraday weather splits each day into four periods (Night/Morning/Afternoon/Evening). Multiple moons with independent cycles, randomized phase modes, and anchor phases. Eclipse calculation using a nodal window model with six subtypes (total/partial/annular solar, total/partial/penumbral lunar).

**Cinematic Time Skip:** Fullscreen animated overlay when time advances by large amounts. PixiJS-rendered sky with day/night cycle, star field, sun arc, shooting stars, and moon orbs with phase masking. A date counter ticks through intermediate days while event cards scroll past. Auto-triggers on configurable thresholds or via a dedicated button in the Set Date dialog. Syncs across all connected clients.

**Chronicle Timeline:** Infinite-scroll timeline showing notes, festivals, season banners, moon phases, and weather history. Two layouts: vertical scroll and alternating left/right timeline cards. Respects fog of war. Three depth modes: Title Only, Excerpts, and Full. Accessible from BigCal, MiniCal, HUD, context menus, toolbar, and API.

**Fog of War:** Players only see dates the GM has revealed. BigCal shows a striped overlay on fogged dates with interactions disabled. MiniCal dims fogged cells. Notes, weather, moons, and festivals are hidden on unrevealed days. Features include a Campaign Start Date lower bound, auto-reveal on day change with configurable radius, and a "Reveal Today to Here" context menu action.

**Text Enrichers:** 51 inline enrichers across 8 categories (Date & Time, Time Math, Calendar, Sun & Daylight, Moon, Weather, Notes, Composite). Embed live calendar data in journal entries, chat, and item descriptions: `[[weather]]`, `[[moon]]`, `[[countdown 1492-6-15]]`, `[[sunrise]]`, `[[season]]`. Enrichers update live when calendar data changes and support cross-calendar targeting.
